<!-- About Section -->
# Welcome

I'm a **full-time independent bug bounty hunter** specializing in identifying vulnerabilities in **AI and machine learning systems** ‚Äî including generative applications, codebases, and model libraries.

I actively participate in multiple bug bounty platforms focused on **securing AI/ML infrastructure**.

My work involves:
- Deep security testing
- AI-specific vulnerability research
- Secure code analysis
- Prompt and inference-level attack simulation

I uncover hidden threats in modern AI ecosystems so companies can move fast without sacrificing security.

<!-- Vulnerabilities Section -->
## üîç Vulnerabilities I Specialize In {#vulnerabilities}

I focus on identifying high-impact, high-complexity vulnerabilities including:

- **Prompt Extraction**
- **Prompt Injection**
- **Interpreter Jailbreaks**
- **Unbounded Consumption**
- **Content Manipulation**
- **Weights & Layers Disclosure**
- **Model File Format Exploits**
- **Multi-Modal Attack Vectors**
- **Secure Code Review**

These vulnerabilities target the AI stack at every level ‚Äî from LLM prompts and APIs to model architecture and behavior.
